Introduction 

For this assignment we were required to develop a well and functional history app for a family friend Sarah who wants her students to use it to teach themselves and educate themselves on technology. This app is called Eternal Chronicles. 

 

Purpose of the app 

The purpose of the app is to educate young minds by comparing users’ ages to famous figures. This app was designed to educate young minds but also for them to have fun using the app.  

 

 Design of the App 

The app design process consists of a series of stages and iterations. It started with a step-by-step plan where we had to plan what information will be in the app, what the app will look like and the code of the app. The history app was called ‘Eternal 	Chronicles’. The history app design with an idea and ends with its application in store. The first thing I considered when designing the history app was that I had to be clear about the functionality the app seeks to address and how users will use it. I had to consider who the user will be which was Sarah’s students to help them learn and have fun using technology and learning about famous deceased people. Sarah wanted her students to be educated while having fun using the app which was considered when designing the app. We planned the app in 4 steps, the conceptualization, the definition, the design, and the development. 

 

Conceptualization is when the designer gathers information from the users about what the app should be about, the needs and the functions of the app, and it is when the designer creates the ideation and the planning of the design.  

 

Definition is when the designer defines in detail and writing who will be the user and what will be the app’s functionality. It helps plan the project properly, it helps the designer know the requirements needed and the duration of the development. 

 

Design is the most important because it is time-consuming and needs a lot of work. The design is split into substages which are; the wireframes, the prototypes, the tests, and the visual design.  

 

Development is when we work on the programming application code and the correction of functional and design bugs that arise after testing the app. The developer then creates the structure on which the app will awork and ensures that the app is functioning successfully.  

 

The designer must design the user experience (UX) is the phase in which the developer is the user testing for any bugs or problems in the app and/or code. This phase defines the app’s processes and content structure. User experiences (UX) are created using wireframes and prototypes which form the basis of the developer’s work.  

The designer must then design the user interface (UI0 which is worked on once the structure, the content, and the functionalities of the app are advanced and working. In this stage the user knows how to use the app without having to think too much or have any problems regarding the app.  

The designer works on the user interface kit (UI-kit). In the user interface kit (UI-kit) they define the following; 

Generic elements 

Color spaces 

General graphic designs 

Typographies 

The designer then moves to the catalog of graphic elements (UI-kit), which include: 

The buttons 

The image sizes 

The lay out 

The content modules 

The visual resources    

The fonts 

The animations 

Once the prototype of the app structure is done and validated, the designer applies the graphic elements (UI-kit) guidelines on the screen which show the designer what the app will look like. They will then also add images, animations, and interactions.  

The goal is to make the user interface simple and easy to use because user satisfaction depends on it. The user should be taken into account throughout the entire design process of the app for user satisfaction to be achieved.

The Picture above shows an empty screen with no designs or structure. The screen will be where we design the app and add all the user experience and user interface. The purpose of the above picture is aimed at presenting the app to the user, its features, and how useful it may be. The screen will be where we design the app and add all the user experience and user interface. The screen will be where we design the app and add all the user experience and user interface. The onboarding app screen has to explain to the user the benefits of the app.

The above picture shows the app finished and designed. Since this is a history app, the designer chose an olden day map to represent history which is what the app is about. The above picture shows "Welcome to Eternal Chronicles", 'Enter Age", "Generate", and "Clear". The "Eternal Chronicles" is the name of the app, and we used a text view to represent the format it is in.

The above picture shows the app finished and designed. Since this is a history app, the designer chose an olden day map to represent the history which is what the app is about. The above picture shows "Welcome to Eternal Chronicles", 'Enter Age", "Generate", and "Clear". The "Eternal Chronicles" button is the name of the app, and we used a text view to represent the format it is in. The "Enter Age" is where the user will insert the age of the famous figure and it is represented by a button. The "Generate" is represented by a button and it will be the area the user clicks to get information about the age they entered.  “The Clear” button removes the age entered by the user to give them an opportunity to enter a new age. 
The above picture the designer was testing the app by entering a number in the data set to see if it produces an answer. The designer entered the age ‘27’, clicked generate and got information about the famous historical figure that died which is Costa Titch for this age range. The user will enter another age range to check if there is a historical figure.

The above picture the designer tested again by entering an age that is not in the data set to see whether it gives   them an error or not.  The ‘100’ age range was not in the data set and therefore gave the user ‘Nothing in data set’.  

 

Github  

In the GitHub app we are creating a repository so we can push our work into GitHub and be able to submit. After creating a repository, you create a branch which helps the designer have different versions of a repository at one time. Make the changes you want to make to the document and commit or push the changes and save the changes to the files in your repository. After committing to the changes in a branch of main, the designer can open a pull request. After committing to the changes, you will merge your readme-edits branch into the main branch. After the designer merges the commits, the changes on your read-edits branch will be incorporated into main.
